# XOR_backpropagation
This repository contains a simple implementation of an XOR logic table using a neural network with backpropagation in TensorFlow. This is just an exercise to demonstrate how to set up and train a neural network for the XOR problem.

## Correct Results

The correct results for the XOR logic table are:

- `0 XOR 0` = `0`
- `0 XOR 1` = `1`
- `1 XOR 0` = `1`
- `1 XOR 1` = `0`

## Results from the Model

The results obtained from the trained model are:

- `0 XOR 0` ≈ `0.02544076`
- `0 XOR 1` ≈ `0.96492815`
- `1 XOR 0` ≈ `0.9661627`
- `1 XOR 1` ≈ `0.04162679`

These results are close to the correct binary outputs, indicating that the model has learned the XOR function well.

## Note

This implementation is intended as an exercise to demonstrate the application of backpropagation using TensorFlow for solving the XOR problem.
